# Next Cloudinary Setup - 5 Minute Guide

## Step 1: Create Upload Preset (REQUIRED!)

Cloudinary upload presets control upload settings and security.

### 1.1 Go to Cloudinary Dashboard

1. Login: <https://console.cloudinary.com/>
2. Click Settings (⚙️) → Upload tab
3. Scroll to "Upload presets"
4. Click "Add upload preset"

### 1.2 Create Preset

**Preset Name:** `pyrarides_reviews`

**Settings:**

```
Signing Mode: Unsigned
Folder: pyrarides/reviews
Format: Auto
Quality: Auto (to reduce file size automatically)
Max File Size: 10 MB
Allowed Formats: jpg, jpeg, png, webp, heic
```

**Click "Save"**

## Step 2: Add Environment Variables

Add to `.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name_here
```

**Where to find Cloud Name:**

- Dashboard homepage shows: `dxxxxxx`
- Copy that value

## Step 3: Restart Dev Server

```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

## Step 4: Test Upload

1. Go to any completed booking
2. Click "Leave Review"
3. Click "Add Photo" button
4. Upload an image
5. Should see Cloudinary upload widget!

## Upload Preset Explanation

**Why "Unsigned"?**

- Allows client-side uploads
- No API secrets in browser
- Still secure (preset controls what's allowed)

**Why "Auto" Format/Quality?**

- Cloudinary optimizes automatically
- Converts to WebP for modern browsers
- Reduces file size by 50-80%

**Folder Structure:**

```
pyrarides/
└── reviews/
    ├── user123/
    │   ├── 1234567890-abc.jpg
    │   └── 1234567891-def.jpg
    └── user456/
        └── 1234567892-ghi.jpg
```
