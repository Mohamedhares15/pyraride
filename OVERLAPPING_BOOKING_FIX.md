# 🔧 **Overlapping Booking Check Fix**

## ✅ **Problem:**
"This horse is already booked for the selected time" error appearing even when time slot should be available.

## 🔍 **Root Causes:**
1. **Too Strict Check**: Was checking both "confirmed" and "completed" bookings
2. **Completed Bookings**: Completed bookings (past rides) were blocking new bookings
3. **Poor Error Messages**: No details about which booking was conflicting

---

## ✅ **Fixes Applied:**

### **1. Improved Booking Status Check**
**Before:**
```typescript
status: {
  in: ["confirmed", "completed"], // ❌ Too strict - includes past bookings
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
status: "confirmed", // ✅ Only check active confirmed bookings
```

**Why**: Completed bookings are in the past and shouldn't block new bookings. Only "confirmed" (active) bookings should prevent overlaps.

### **2. Better Overlap Detection Logic**
**Before:**
```typescript
OR: [
  {
    startTime: { lte: end },
    endTime: { gte: start },
  },
],
```

**After:**
```typescript
AND: [
  {
    startTime: { lte: end }, // Booking starts before our end time
  },
  {
    endTime: { gte: start }, // Booking ends after our start time
  },
],
```

**Why**: Using `AND` ensures both conditions are true for a real overlap, making the check more accurate.

### **3. Enhanced Error Messages**
**Before:**
```typescript
{ error: "This horse is already booked for the selected time" }
```

**After:**
```typescript
{ 
  error: "This horse is already booked for the selected time",
  details: `Conflicting booking: ${conflictStart} - ${conflictEnd}. Please choose a different time.`
}
```

**Why**: Users can see exactly which booking is conflicting, helping them choose a different time.

## 📋 **What Statuses Are Checked:**

### ✅ **Confirmed** - Checked (blocks new bookings)
- Active bookings that haven't been completed
- These are actual conflicts and should block new bookings

### ❌ **Completed** - Not Checked
- Past bookings that are already done
- Should NOT block new bookings (horse is available again)

### ❌ **Cancelled** - Not Checked  
- Cancelled bookings
- Should NOT block new bookings (slot is free)

### ❌ **Pending** - Not Checked (in some routes)
- Bookings awaiting payment
- Usually treated similar to confirmed

## 🎯 **How It Works Now:**

1. **User selects time**: e.g., Oct 30, 2025, 9:00 AM - 10:00 AM
2. **System checks**: Only "confirmed" bookings for that horse
3. **If conflict found**: Shows detailed error with conflicting booking time
4. **If no conflict**: Booking proceeds successfully

---

## ✅ **Result:**

- ✅ Only active confirmed bookings block new bookings
- ✅ Completed bookings don't block new bookings
- ✅ Better error messages help users pick available times
- ✅ More accurate overlap detection
