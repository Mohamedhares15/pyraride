## 🏢 **How to Create a STABLE OWNER Account:**

### **Problem:** There's no UI yet to register a stable!

### **Solution 1: Manual Database Update** ⚡ FASTEST

I'll create a script for you!

### **Solution 2: Via Neon Console** ⚡ FASTEST

**Steps:**
1. Go to: https://console.neon.tech
2. Open your `pyraride` database
3. Click "SQL Editor" → "New Query"
4. Run this SQL (replace `YOUR_USER_EMAIL` with actual email):

```sql
-- First, find your user ID
SELECT id, email, role FROM "User" WHERE email = 'YOUR_USER_EMAIL@example.com';

-- Then, update their role to stable_owner
UPDATE "User" SET role = 'stable_owner' WHERE email = 'YOUR_USER_EMAIL@example.com';
```

5. ✅ Now that user is a stable owner!

### **Solution 3: Add Stable Registration UI** (Future Enhancement)

We need to add:
- `/register-stable` page for users to apply
- Admin approval system
- Email notifications
