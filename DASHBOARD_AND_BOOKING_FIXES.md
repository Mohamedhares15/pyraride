# 🔧 **Dashboard & Booking System Fixes**

## ✅ **Issues Fixed:**

### **1. Analytics Dashboard (`/dashboard/analytics`)**
**Issue**: Revenue/earnings display error when data is missing  
**Fix**: 
- Fixed conditional logic to properly handle admin vs stable owner analytics
- Added null checks for `totalRevenue` and `netEarnings`
- Fixed `platformCommission` display with proper null checks

### **2. Booking System (`/api/bookings`)**
**Issues Fixed**:
- ✅ **Past Date Validation**: Added check to prevent bookings in the past
- ✅ **Minimum Duration**: Enforced 1-hour minimum booking duration
- ✅ **Time Validation**: Improved validation for start/end times
- ✅ **Overlapping Bookings**: Already working correctly

### **3. Stable Owner Dashboard (`/dashboard/stable`)**
**Issues Fixed**:
- ✅ **Missing API Endpoint**: Created `/api/stables/[id]/bookings` endpoint
- ✅ **Stable Data Fetching**: Fixed to properly fetch owner's stable using `?ownerOnly=true` query
- ✅ **Bookings Display**: Now correctly fetches and displays bookings
- ✅ **Statistics Calculation**: Fixed earnings calculation with proper decimal handling
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Added proper error messages when stable not found

## 📋 **New Features Added:**

### **1. Stable Bookings API (`/api/stables/[id]/bookings`)**
- Returns all bookings for a specific stable
- Protected: Only stable owners and admins can access
- Includes rider and horse information
- Ordered by creation date (newest first)

### **2. Owner-Only Stable Query**
- Added `ownerOnly=true` query parameter to `/api/stables`
- Returns only the logged-in stable owner's stable
- Used by stable owner dashboard for faster data fetching

## 🧪 **Booking Validation Scenarios Tested:**

### ✅ **Valid Bookings:**
1. Future date booking (tomorrow or later)
2. Valid time range (end time after start time)
3. Minimum 1-hour duration
4. No overlapping bookings for same horse
5. Active horse and approved stable

### ❌ **Invalid Bookings (Now Blocked):**
1. ❌ Past date booking → "Booking start time must be in the future"
2. ❌ End time before start time → "End time must be after start time"
3. ❌ Less than 1 hour → "Minimum booking duration is 1 hour"
4. ❌ Overlapping time slot → "This horse is already booked for the selected time"
5. ❌ Missing required fields → "Missing required fields"
6. ❌ Invalid horse or stable → Proper error messages
