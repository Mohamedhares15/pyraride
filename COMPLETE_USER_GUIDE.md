UPDATE "User" 
SET role = 'stable_owner' 
WHERE email = 'stable-owner@example.com';

-- Then create their stable (replace ownerId with the user's actual ID from database)
INSERT INTO "Stable" (id, "ownerId", name, description, location, address, status)
VALUES (gen_random_uuid(), 'USER_ID_HERE', 'My Stable', 'A great stable', 'Giza', 'Pyramids Road', 'approved');
```
4. ✅ Stable owner account created!
