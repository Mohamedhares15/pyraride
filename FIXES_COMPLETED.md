# âœ… **FIXES COMPLETED**

## ðŸš€ **What I Just Fixed:**

**1. Footer âœ…**
- Changed Hero from `min-h-screen` to `h-screen` (100vh only)
- Added Footer to `app/page.tsx`
- Footer should now be visible below hero

**2. Dashboard Routing âœ…**
- Improved `/dashboard/page.tsx` to handle all roles
- Added loading states
- Added fallback for unknown roles

## ðŸ§ª **PLEASE TEST NOW:**

**Visit**: https://pyraride.vercel.app

**Check these:**
1. âœ… Scroll down - Footer should be visible
2. âœ… Click "Dashboard" - should redirect to /dashboard/rider (or your role)
3. âœ… Weather widget working (already confirmed)

**Then tell me what's STILL broken!**
