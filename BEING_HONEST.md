# ‚ùå **I Can't Test the Site Myself**

I **cannot** open the browser and test the site. You need to tell me what's broken.

## üîß **What I Just Fixed:**
1. Changed background image URL (Unsplash horse riding)
2. Added Gallery, About, Contact to navbar

## ‚ùì **What I CAN'T Verify:**
- If the background image is showing correctly
- If the navigation links work
- If pages load properly

**I NEED YOU TO TEST AND TELL ME:**
1. Is the background showing horses or still a car?
2. Do the Gallery/About/Contact links work when clicked?
3. What exactly is broken?

Then I'll fix it. I won't claim anything is done until you confirm it works.
